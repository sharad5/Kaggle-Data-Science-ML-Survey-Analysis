The Future of Fresh is Here!

Food isn’t what it used to be. We made it better, and we did it by building a different kind of farm. A farm that doesn’t need sun, soil or favorable weather to do its thing. A farm where pesticides have no place—because everything’s indoors, monitored and controlled, 24/7. We built a farm where robots do the heavy lifting, so the humans can focus on growing the freshest, most nutritious food possible. A farm that can produce over 300 times more food than an ordinary farm. With 100% renewable energy. And 97% less water. Pretty unbelievable, right? Well, believe it. This farm is real. We call it 80 Acres Farms. Fresher food awaits you.

Powering 80 Acres Farms is the Infinite Acres technology platform, our closed loop, integrated, end-to end system with best-in-class hardware, software, and controls. The research and data teams at Infinite Acres give our farms the information and technology that make our plants grow better.

By combining our world-class technology with super-efficient vertical farming techniques, we produce a lot more in a much smaller space.

If you’re the kind of person who wants to make a difference and is fast on your feet, join a team that is shaking things up in the local food chain.

24,Full Stack Developer,Service Objects,"California, United States",Remote,Full-time,11-50 employees,None,"Full Stack Developer
Service Objects is growing, and we are looking to fill a key position as a Full Stack Developer in the Applications Engineering department where you’ll primarily be working on a wide variety of integration projects. You'll be working with our users to gather information about their targeted platform and working out the best integration solutions. The right candidate should be experienced, self-motivated and able to work with minimal supervision.
Brief Requirements
You’re an experienced server-side developer that knows how to ship, monitor, and maintain large SaaS apps (not just websites).
You have experience with one or more CRM or Marketing Automation platforms at the customization, coding and/or API level.
We care more about a high proficiency level than years of experience, but we expect at least three years of software development experience. When we say full stack developer we mean that you’re a programmer at heart, are comfortable at various levels of the web stack, and are familiar with both server-side and browser-side development.
That is a short intro to what we are looking for. First, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our Core Values have to really click with you.
If you’re smiling when you read our Core Values, you’ll probably fit right in at SO.
We live our core values every day, and we mean it when we say we provide a happy and healthy work experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people… the kind you’ll be excited to work with.
What’s in it for you?
We care deeply about employee wellness and benefits. You will receive a comprehensive leave and wellness benefit package, including:
100% paid medical, dental, and vision insurance for you and your entire family
11 paid holidays
16 days of paid time off
Flexible spending accounts
Remote, hybrid and in-office work options
Short & long-term disability insurance
Employee assistance plan
Life insurance
Adoption assistance
Bonus plan based on company revenue
Education assistance
Home internet and wireless phone allowance
Competitive Compensation
The average salary range for a candidate living in the State of California is $102,135-$111,201. Actual salary will be determined by the candidate’s city and state of residence and transferable years of experience to this position. Salary may be higher or lower than listed once residency and experience is determined by Service Objects. We may consider an individual bonus for you for successful effort and have a company-wide quarterly bonus program based on revenue, which you're in on from day one. SO wins, you win—that kind of thing.
Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer…
Our goal is to make sure that every contact record in every system is accurate and genuine – and for the whole planet. No small chore, right?
In 2022, we're focused on building integrations (add-ins, plug-ins, connections) to the systems that our clients use most – to help them resolve their data quality problems.
Looking forward, you’ll also help us improve our workflow system to deliver top-notch solutions for our users. We have been growing. A lot. We’ve worked hard to create teams that are autonomous and outcome-focused, but we’ll never be ones to rest on our laurels. We expect you to speak up when you see an opportunity to improve our processes, and to embrace change as we continue to grow.
When needed, you’ll provide one-to-one support (it’s one of our core values) to our end users. As software developer, you will be responsible for working with our users to direct them on best integration practices and design services to meet their needs.
To be successful in this role you’ll need to:
Be confident with the server-side languages like Ruby, Java, C#, etc.
Understand front-end development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you.
Comfortable working with users to understand their integration needs and help define and execute an integration solution.
Be familiar with DevOps tools and services like Azure DevOps or GitHub.
Possess effective communication skills to share technical information between various groups.
This is a full-time position. However, we want everyone to have a happy life outside of SO, and we seldom work more than 40 hours per week. There are occasions where things get busy and you may be expected you put in some extra time. We work hard and smart so we can stay in this for the long haul.
Since early 2020 we’ve been a fully remote team and we plan to stay permanently remote, so you can live and work wherever you want (with a reliable internet connection) in the United States. You'll be working with folks predominately on the West Coast of the United States for a significant portion of your time, due to the nature of collaboration and communication, a West Coast candidate is strongly preferred.
How to Apply
To apply, please e-mail us at jobs@serviceobjects.com and attach the following three items:
Include your favorite knock-knock joke (plenty of room for creativity here).
Include a PDF of your cover letter explaining why this position is of interest to you.
What attracted you to this position?

If you have a resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don't have a resume because you aren't even sure you're looking to change jobs, that's fine! Please include a list of your work and education history.
We'll send you a confirmation email once you apply. Please add that email to your safe sender list so that future emails come through.

You are eager to work in a dynamic and fast-paced early stage startup, and have an ability to roll up your sleeves to #GetShiftDone.

Operating Principles @ Shiftsmart

See Leadership Principles @ Amazon (article)

Execution Is Binary

We #GetShiftDone. We take immense pride in both the quality of our work and our relentless determination to deliver on our commitments. If we say we are going to do something, we do it.

We own the outcome with an unstoppable mindset through the finish line and are impatient to move the ball forward. This means we work really hard, execute with urgency, and ruthlessly challenge timelines for anything important. As a result, we do not defer responsibility to other teams or individuals. Instead, we take the problem as far as we can and only when needed ask others for help.

Each time a crisis or opportunity emerges we take the hill as one team, because we are allergic to the words ""it can't be done"".

Missionaries, Not Mercenaries

We before me. We believe in our mission to build a better world for workers. We understand why our work matters and take seriously how it impacts our customers and our partners. This belief permeates everything we do from the strategic to the mundane.

We are energetic, ambitious, and want to win. We constantly raise the standards for ourselves and everyone around us. We show up for our customers, our partners, and most importantly our teammates, and make every effort to build lasting relationships with each of them.

We do not measure success based on our titles or the size of our empires. This also means we put the needs of the business before the details of our job descriptions. Rather than fight for a bigger piece of the pie, we fight to grow the entire thing and recognize this is how to grow our careers too.

Inputs > Outcomes

We work really hard. Fundamentally changing how labor works is not easy. It often requires long days, late nights, and weekends to deliver on our commitments. We lean into this challenge.

We focus on the process. We think in terms of value chains and appreciate that a bad process with a good outcome is simply dumb luck.

We lead with data. We use facts, not fiction, to build narratives and make decisions. To do this we prepare written memos in advance and resist the urge to engage in endless water cooler what ifs, because we value the time and attention of our teammates.

We hire and develop the best. When we decide to hire a new team member, we do so because we believe they will increase the talent density on our team. We view ourselves as leverage maximizers rather than inconvenience reducers and strive to increase the output of everyone we interact with.

Honesty Over Harmony

We share the truth even when it is painful. We do not, however, share the truth callously to hurt people's feelings or make them look bad. We also assume positive intent. If someone is not delivering in a way that we need, we ask them and tell them before assuming the worst.

We embrace mutual feedback. As people leaders we care more about our team's growth and success than how much others like us. As individuals we seek, accept, and apply feedback. We do not give or take feedback personally because we understand it enables us to learn and grow.

We tell the truth to ourselves. We reject a pollyannaish view of our world. Instead if something isn't going well that we are responsible for, we call it out. And when someone calls out their own truth that may be less optimal, we don't punish them for it.

We have the meeting in the meeting. If something is broken or we disagree, we call it out and say something in the moment even if it feels uncomfortable to do so. This means that if something is broken, we do not just accept it and complain later.

Invent & Iterate

We are inventors @ heart. We categorically reject the phrase ""that is how it's always been done"", and constantly discover new and better ways to do more with less. This means we are resourceful and often do things that don't scale, only to create ways to scale them later. We're builders.

We think BIG. At every level of the company, we embrace big, hairy, audacious, and transformative goals. We fear lack of progress and incremental thinking more than failing to deliver or falling short of an audacious goal. We believe courage means to try without fear and learn without ego.

We do not let perfect get in the way of better. When faced with the choice we prioritize delivering something, even if imperfect, over endless debate and alignment. We embrace good mistakes.

Equal opportunity employer

Shiftsmart is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.",3365948131

We aspire to build incredible things which starts with building an incredible team, so we’d love to hear from you! 😄

About the role 🎉
We’re building a next-generation creative tool that enables a new level of interactivity with cloud-based machine learning models. For our tool to be maximally expressive, we’re working to establish a seamless feedback loop between our users and the machine learning models powering Runway’s abilities. It’s not sufficient for our models to be accurate; nor is it enough for our user interface to be beautiful and responsive; we need to ensure that the link between the two is as fast and reliable as possible.

For this reason, we’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who can help us create the server-side engine that powers our interactive tools for image and video synthesis. You’ll be working closely with our research and frontend teams to design and build low-latency, high-reliability machine learning deployments. We’re looking for someone who is deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning and systems design, and has extensive experience building web-based real-time server applications.

A peek at our technical stack 🔍
The rich UI of our video editing and collaboration tools is powered by Typescript and React/Redux, while the real time compositing and graphics engine behind our interactive preview runs on WebGL2 and WebAssembly. Our video streaming backend components are written in Python, use a lot of FFmpeg/libav and HLS for on-the-fly transcoding, PyTorch and TorchScript for ML inference, and are deployed as containerized services on Kubernetes. Our API endpoints for real-time collaboration and media asset management are written in Typescript and node.js and are deployed as serverless functions on AWS Lambda.

What you’ll do 🎨
Work with a world-class engineering team pushing the boundaries of content creation on the browser
Collaborate with our research team to deploy state-of-the-art computer vision models to production
Improve the performance and efficiency of our machine learning deployments

What you’ll need 💻
Solid knowledge of at least one machine learning research framework (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow), and at least one high-performance inference framework (e.g. TensorRT, Apache TVM)
Experience profiling and optimizing deep neural networks, including knowledge of GPU profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight
Familiarity with Python-based image and video manipulation/encoding/decoding frameworks, such as OpenCV and PyAV
Experience with cloud orchestration systems such as Kubernetes and cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure
Ability to write robust and maintainable client-server architectures and APIs
Ability to rapidly prototype solutions and iterate on them with tight product deadlines
Strong communication, collaboration, and documentation skills

Working at Runway 🥳
We are a small and growing team of artists, engineers, researchers, and dreamers working together to reimagine creativity. And we’re building a unique team of talented individuals from diverse backgrounds. We believe that this will allow us to continue to up-level each other, our company, and our product. We’re looking for people that will add to our culture, not just fit in.

We’re committed to creating a space where our employees can bring their full selves to work and have equal opportunity to succeed. So regardless of race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, origin, ability, age, veteran status, if joining this mission speaks to you, we encourage you to apply!",3360791206

We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)

Your Experience

We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved. You have worked at meaningful scale before and want to do so again. You also have the below experience and skills:

4+ years working in Ruby on Rails as well as a Rails codebase
Managing AWS infrastructure using terraform
Using containerization and build systems
Producing fast, efficient, and reliable services
Writing high-performance systems based on Kafka
Your work at Aha!

This Includes

As Sr. Platform Engineer, you will support the rest of the engineering team by developing abstractions, frameworks, and tools which help other Aha. engineers build the product.

Building developer tooling such as CI pipelines, local and staging environments, and helpful CLI tools. You will also assist the SRE team in building out monitoring and observability pipelines
Building infrastructure services to be used by Aha! product developers. This will usually include writing a reference architecture in our main Rails app
Working with the SRE team to write and maintain well-written production runbook and operations documentation
Consulting with application developers on performance optimization or scaling challenges

If the Sr. Platform Engineer role sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. (A real human reviews every application.)

Grow with us

At Ford, the health and safety of our employees is our top priority. Vaccination has been proven to play a critical role in combating COVID-19. As a result, Ford has made the decision to require U.S. salaried employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, unless employees require an accommodation for religious or medical reasons. Being fully vaccinated means that an individual is at least two weeks past their final dose of an authorized COVID-19 vaccine regimen. As a condition of employment, newly hired employees will be required to provide proof of their COVID-19 vaccination or an approved medical or religious exemption.

Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.

We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize. That said, some of the largest companies in the world store a large amount of their precious strategic data in Aha!, so we do plenty of optimizing too.

We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.

We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.
