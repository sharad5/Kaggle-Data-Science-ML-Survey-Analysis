## Project Description
We are using Kaggle annual data science and machine learning survey responses data from 2022 and previous years. 
Data Sources: 
* [2022 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2022/data)
* [2021 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2021/data)
* [2020 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2020/data)

Hypothesis/Analysis to follow


<!-- ## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
